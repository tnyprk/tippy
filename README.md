## Notes

This was my first time ever using xCode and coding in swift. Learning how to use a new program and naviagating through where things are 
was challenging at first. However, I was able to learn quickly on how things work. I have completed the minimum requirements for now since 
I did not have much time to work on it. Once I do, I will be adding more features to the app.
